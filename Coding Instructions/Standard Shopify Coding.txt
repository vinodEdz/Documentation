
ALL work must be committed to Github / make a commit after you finish working on a file or a feature - this will make troubleshooting easier than if you were to commit once a day

Use Shopify Theme Kit- do not work in the browser

Coding Notes
1. Section and comment CSS carefully
2. Use the existing grid styles (start on line 941 of theme.scss.liquid) - more information on grid styles found at https://shopify.github.io/Timber/#grid
3. DO NOT include inline styles - all styles must go in custom.scss
4. DO NOT use !important
5. DO NOT float elements, use the grid styles to position them
